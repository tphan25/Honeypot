### 1) Which Honeypot(s) you deployed

Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP was used for the Honeypot.

### 2) Any issues you encountered

On my first personal creation of the HoneyPot, my configuration was incorrect with some of the servers and so I had to use new setup servers for a second attempt at it. Also, the initial github repo linked in the instructions was incorrect.

### 3) A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.

There were 1144 attacks. A couple of IPs had numerous attacks, including some from around the world in France especially. Not sure what malware samples could be collected from the data given in the MHN admin app.

What types of attacks were these? What were the attackers' goals in doing so? What could they do if they actually took over a real server?
